# Roadcreator
A free road creation tool for unity.

## Features:
### Road Creation
- Place, move and delete points to create a series of curves
- Generate roads with different width, texture and much more.
- Customizable shoulders(extra meshes), possible to have multiple on each side
- Options are changed per-segment which allows for more control like the road having a extra lane before a intersection
- Terrain deformation to make the terrain adjust to the road
- Easly make a road into a bridge with automatic pillar placement (see bridge section)

### Bridges 
- Generate bridges with only a few click!.
- Currently 12 are included but you can easly add your own. The tool with modify the bridge mesh so that it fits the mesh perfectly
- Generate pillars automaticly with options such as: gap, scale and rotation direction
- Adapt to custom bridge option to automatically align the pillars with the custom bridge mesh.

### Intersections
- Procedurally generated intersections, easly create them by connecting two roads end/start points
- Easly customize intersections by moving points and changing how sharp the connections should be (per connection)
- Move the connected road points when the intersection is selected to have full control over the intersection mesh
- Customizable shoulders(extra meshes), possible to have multiple on each side
- Procedural roundabouts with changable radius etc. Has the same smooth connections and customizability as normal intersections, including extra mesh and bridge support.
