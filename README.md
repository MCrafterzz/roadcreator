# Roadcreator
A free road creation tool for unity.

## Features:
### Road Creation
- Place, move and delete points to create a series of curves
- Generate roads with different width, texture and much more
- Customizable shoulders(extra meshes), possible to have multiple on each side
- Options are changed per-segment which allows for more control like the road having a extra lane before a intersection
- Terrain deformation to make the terrain adjust to the road
- Easly make a road into a bridge with automatic pillar placement (see bridge section)

### Prefab Line Tool
- Includes a prefab line tool to place prefabs along a series of curves
- Many customization options including: changing rotation direction, scale (per-axis) and adapt to terrain
- Option to have a different start/end prefab which is useful for example guard rails
- Options to curve the mesh and also to fill in the gap between them to get a smoothly curved and connected line of prefabs

### Bridges 
- Generate bridges with only a few click!.
- Currently 12 are included but you can easly add your own. The tool will modify the bridge mesh so that it fits the road mesh perfectly, it also matches the extra meshes
- Generate pillars automaticly with options such as: gap, scale and rotation direction
- Adapt to custom bridge option to automatically align the pillars with the custom bridge mesh

### Intersections
- Procedurally generated intersections, easly create them by connecting two roads end/start points
- Easly customize intersections by moving points and changing how sharp the connections should be (per connection), also an option to generate smooth curves automatically
- Move the connected road points when the intersection is selected to have full control over the intersection mesh
- Customizable shoulders(extra meshes), possible to have multiple on each side
- Easly generate nice looking turn markings automaticlly by changing few options
- Bridge support including pillar placement
- Procedural roundabouts with changable radius etc. Has the same smooth connections and customizability as normal intersections, including extra mesh and bridge support

### Other
- Includes a bunch of roads and road related assets like crossings and road signs
- Create timed traffic lights
